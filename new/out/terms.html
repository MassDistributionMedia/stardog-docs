<p>In the Stardog documentation, the following terms have a specific
technical meaning.</p>

<h1 id="terminologychapter">Terminology {#chapter}</h1>
<dl>
<dt>Stardog Database Management System, aka Stardog Server, aka Stardog</dt>
<dd>An instance of Stardog: only one Stardog Server may run per JVM. A
 computer may run multiple Stardog Servers by running one per
 multiple JVMs.
Stardog Home, aka <code>STARDOG_HOME</code></dd>

<dd>A directory in a filesystem in which Stardog stores files and other
 information; established either in a Stardog configuration file or
 by environment variable. Only one Stardog Server may run
 simultaneously from a <code>STARDOG_HOME</code>.
Stardog Network Home</dd>

<dd>A URL (HTTP or SNARL) which identifies a Stardog Server running on
 the network.
Database</dd>

<dd>A Stardog database is a graph of RDF data under management of a
 Stardog Server. It may contain zero or more RDF Named Graphs. A
 Stardog Server may manage more than one Database; there is no hard
 limit, and the practical limit is disk space.
Database Short Name, aka Database Name</dd>

<dd>An identifier used to name a database, provided as input when a
 database is created.
Database Network Name</dd>

<dd>A Database Short Name is part of the URI of a Database addressed
 over some network protocol.
Index</dd>

<dd>The unit of persistence for a Database. We sometimes (sloppily) use
 Database and Index interchangeably in the Stardog docs.
Memory Database</dd>

<dd>A Database may be stored in-memory or on disk; a Memory Database is
 read entirely into system memory but can be (optionally) persisted
 to disk.
Disk Database</dd>

<dd>A Disk Database is only paged into system memory as needed and is
 persisted using one or more indexes.
Connection String</dd>

<dd>An identifier (a restricted subset of legal URLs, actually) that is
 used to connect to a Stardog database to send queries or perform
 other operations.
Named Graph</dd>

<dd>A Named Graph is an explicitly named unit of data within a Database.
 Named Graphs are queries explicitly by specifying them in SPARQL
 queries. There is no practical limit on the number of Named Graphs
 in a Database.
Default Graph</dd>

<dd>The Default Graph in a Database is the context into which RDF
 triples are stored when a Named Graph is not explicitly specified. A
 SPARQL query executed by Stardog that does not contain any Named
 Graph statements is executed against the data in the Default Graph
 only.
Security Realm</dd>

<dd>A Security Realm defines the users and their permissions for each
 Database in an Stardog Server. There is only one Security Realm per
 Stardog Server.</dd>
